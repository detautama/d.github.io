## 📌 My new personal website

I have been created personal website using my own domain. But I take it down because I think it will not useful because it only provide like card name. And not suitable with cost of domain 💰. So I will try to use this github pages with concept "My Programming Diary". I will post my activity here like a bookmark and hopefully will be useful for other too 🙂. Also I don't want to confused about code and design of the website 😆. <br />
